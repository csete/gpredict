Changes in version 0.7.0 (3 Jan 2007):

- Automatic update of TLE elements from network or local files. Gpredict can
  either notify the user when TLEs are getting too old, or perform automatic
  update in the background. The network update requires libcurl.
- Added optional grid lines to the map view (30 deg resolution).
- Added possibility to show ground tracks on the map (feature request #557586)
- Added support for the optional operational status of satellites encoded into
  the satellite names in TLE coming from CelesTrak.

  'make install DESTDIR=/foo' (patch #1552216 by Denis Leroy).
- Fixed bug that caused errors when user deleted the sample ground station while
  one or more modules were still using it (reported by Hamish Moffatt).


Changes in version 0.6.0 (4 Sep 2006):

- New module design: A module is no longer either a list or a map. A module can
  contain up to three views that can be any combination of map, list, polar and
  single satellite view.
- Each module can be configured individually (colours, views, location) or it
  can use the global default settings.
- Module have three states: Docked, Window and fullscreen.
- Improved map view quality and performance with possibility to highlight areas
  covered by satellites.
- List View is fully configurable with respect to which columns should be
  visible. Furthermore, the list view has a lots of new columns.
- The upcoming passes dialogs can show much more details like TCA, duration and
  maximum elevation.
- Context sensitive pop-up menus instead of buttons to access the most important
  functions.
- Geographical coordinates can be shown using N, S, E and W suffixes instead
  og sign. This should settle the debate on whether negative longitude is East
  or West of Greenwich (I know which one is the correct one ;-).
- Added support for imperial units (default is still the metric system).
- Added support for user specified time format strings.
- No upper limit on the number of satellites.
- Uses SGP4/SDP4 algorithms for element set propagation.
- Requires Gtk+ 2.8 or later and GNOME dependencies are gone for good!
- Gpredict is now much more robust against configuration errors. If something
  goes wrong you can simply delete all user configuration files and start from
  fresh. Besides that, gpredict only uses human readable configuration files,
  which can be edited using a text editor. It should, however, never be necessary
  to alter the configuration files manually.
- Draft User Manual and Design Document.


Changes in version 0.5.3 (19 Jan 2006):

- Fixed errors when compiling on NetBSD, thanks to Berndt VK5ABN. This patch
  actually fixes the i18n installation problems on the other platforms too.


Changes in version 0.5.2 (22 Dec 2005):

- Fixed errors when compiling without hamlib support.


Changes in version 0.5.1 (25 May 2005):

- Selecting local time instead of UTC will now show the correct time
  everywhere in the program, thanks to Thierry F4DWV.
- Show pass duration in minutes in the "Upcoming Passes" dialog.


Changes in version 0.5.0 (29 Jan 2005):

- It is now possible to specify a minimum elevation for upcoming passes.
  Passes with max elevation below this limit will be discaded from the list.
- Hamlib 1.2.0 support. If compiled with hamlib support, gpredict now
  requires version 1.2.0 or later and will not compile with earlier
  versions.
- Possibility for other map sizes. Gpredict will automatically detect
  the size of the map and scale the canvas accordingly.
- Improved map display showing QTH, time, upcoming satellite and brief info
  about a selected satellite. Added buttons for pass prediction for selected
  satellite.
- Satellite lists can be sorted automatically at regular intervals
  (preferences->lists->autosort). Disabled by default.
- Satmap-druid will now open a warning dialog if the number of
  selected satellites is greater than 10 (bug #555595).
- Fixed positioning and alignment errors in AOS prints. Added orbit
  number to detailed prints. 
- We now use the standard Gnome data directories (incompatible with
  previous releases). This means, that the 'configure --prefix=...'
  and other directory switches should work now.
- Replaced obsolete ftime function with gettimeofday. The program should
  now compile on MacOS X and FreeBSD as well.
- Simple and detailed pass predictions can again be saved to text files
  (bug #839373).
- Show rise/set times in Sun and Moon frames.


Changes in version 0.4.0 (17 Apr 2003):

- TLE files are now stored in user's home directory in 
  $HOME/.gpredict/tle and can be updated automatically at run time.
  The supplied files are identicale to those at celestrak.com except
  that the extensions have been changed from .txt to .tle
- The tracked satellites are organized in a tree when presented to
  the user, rather than a flat list.
- Updated locations database with more than 2000 known locations
  with altitude and weather station info. The known locations
  are now organized in a tree structure. If Hamlib 1.1.3 is available
  locator squares are calculated as well.
- Possibility to have many locations configured and switch between
  them at runtime.
- Possibility to use other maps. Gnome Predict comes bundled with 5
  different maps, but the user can add and use his/her own maps by
  copying the images into the $HOME/.gpredict/maps/ directory. The maps
  will automatically be scaled to 800x400 pixels.
- Notebook tabs/labels are only shown if there are at least
  two modules in the notebook (the user can override it though).
- Module names can be up to 50 characters long.
- Modules can be deleted and edited after creation (right-click in the
  iconbar).
- Program is safe if a satellite somehow disappears from the database.
- Fixed bugs #636186 and #633886.


Changes in version 0.3.2 (24 Jun 2002):

- No more crash when trying to open a deleted map file
  (bug #554785).

  the user creates a new module (bug #555595).

- Updated gpredict.pot
- Updated da.po (new strings not translated though).

- Fixed bug #551224.


Changes in version 0.3.0 (13 Apr 2002):

- Configuration is stored using GConf instead of gnome-config.
- Default prefix is no longer /usr/local/groundstation
- User configuration files are stored in ~/.gpredict/
  (previously ~/.groundstation/)
- Longitude is in the range of -180 to 180 negative being East of
  Greenwich.
- Get detailed information about any of the upcoming passes. The plot
  showing a satellite pass can be saved as an image or printed.
- New earth map module with the possibility to save and print the map
  as an image.
- Anti aliased graphics giving much better quality. The user can disable
  this feature if the performance is very poor.
- New shortcut bar.
- Have as many modules open as your computer can handle.
- Disabled the possibility to change the TLE file at runtime
  (obsolete feature).


Changes in version 0.2.2 (23 Oct 2001):

- Program can read custom TLE files even at runtime.
- New, very flexible functions to predict upcoming passes.
- Show/Save/Print/Plot detailed info about the upcoming pass.

  any state a satellite can have.
- More options in the preferences box.


Changes in version 0.2.1:

- Just added a sentence to INSTALL about not to
  use ~ in --prefix=...


Changes in version 0.2.0 (4 Aug 2001):

  chaged by editing the 'defaults.h' file)
- Predict AOS and LOS times for upcoming passes
- The user can change the text colors in the satellite list
- The user can change the time between satellite list updates
