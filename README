Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program
for the Linux desktop. It uses the SGP4/SDP4 propagation algorithms together
with NORAD two-line element sets (TLE).

Some core features of Gpredict include:

- Tracking of a large number of satellites only limited by the physical
  memory and processing power of the computer
- Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any combination
  of these
- Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own
  windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode
- You can use many ground stations
- Predict upcoming passes
- Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and
  backward), and manual time control
- Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes
- Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld
- Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld

Requirements
------------

Gpredict is written using the Gtk+ 3 widget set, which is available for most
Unix like operating systems, Mac and Windows. Following libraries are required
for successful compilation of Gpredict:

- Gtk+ 3 or later
- GLib 2.32 or later
- GooCanvas 2
- Libcurl 7.16 or later
- Hamlib (runtime only, not required for build)

If you compile Gpredict from source you will also need the development packages
often with -dev or -devel in the package name, e.g. libgtk-3-dev. On Debian and
Ubuntu systems you can install the build dependencies using:

  sudo apt install dh-autoreconf intltool libcurl4-openssl-dev make
  sudo apt install pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libgoocanvas-2.0-dev


To build and install gpredict from source, first unpack the source package:

  tar -xvf gpredict-x.y.z.tar.gz

Then change to the gpredict-x.y.z directory and build gpredict:

  ./configure
  make -j$(( $(nproc) + 1))
  make install

The last step usually requires you to become root, otherwise you may not have
the required permissions to install gpredict. If you can not or do not want to
install gpredict as root, you can install gpredict into a custom directory by
adding --prefix=somedir to the ./configure step. For example

  ./configure --prefix="$HOME/predict"
  
will configure the build to install the files into /home/user/predict folder.

If you are building directly from the git repository, you have to run
./autogen.sh instead of of configure. You can pass the same options to the
autogen.sh script as you would to the configure script.

If you want to know more about installation options refer to the INSTALL file
(not for beginners).


Using Gpredict
--------------

Gpredict comes bundled with some example data and will run "out of the box".
Once you got the idea of the UI, you can either modify the settings of the
default module (click on the small down-arrow in the top right corner), or
create a new module through File -> New Module.

You are highly encouraged to have a look at the user manual available at
