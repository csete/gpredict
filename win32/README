### Win32 build notes ###

# Phil Ashby, Dec 2017 - Jan 2018

At present, MSYS2 on a Windows system is required to gather dependencies
before building a Win32 version of gpredict using this build system.

Install MSYS2, open a shell and install the Gtk3 and Goocanvas2 packages,
following the instructions from GTK team:
https://www.gtk.org/download/windows.php

Once your MSYS2 output folder (/mingw32 or simlar) is accessible from
this system, adjust the MINGW_ROOT parameter in config.mk to suit.

You should now be able to cross-compile the Win32 version of GPredict
using the 'make' command.

Experimental Win32 build testing is being tracked in this ticket:
https://github.com/csete/gpredict/issues/110


To build a deployable ZIP archive, use 'make dist', which packages all
binary DLLs from dependant packages along with gpredict[-con].exe into
a versioned ZIP.

Good luck!
Phlash.
